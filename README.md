Introduction 
In recent years, student mental health has become a growing concern worldwide, with increasing numbers of students experiencing psychological distress during their academic journey. Depression, in particular, is one of the most prevalent and serious mental health conditions among students, often triggered or exacerbated by academic pressure, lifestyle habits, and personal or familial psychological history. Early identification and intervention are crucial in addressing student depression and preventing long-term consequences.

This study aims to explore the key factors associated with student depression using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing demographic, academic, lifestyle, and psychological variables, we seek to identify which features contribute most significantly to depression risk. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of different predictive models and determine the most effective and interpretable approach for identifying students at risk. Ultimately, our research provides insights that may inform preventative strategies and support systems for student mental health.
